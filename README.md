🚀 SOAR-Flow
📌 Project Description
This project demonstrates how to integrate Shuffle SOAR with Wazuh SIEM and TheHive to automate incident response.

✅ Receiving security alerts from Wazuh.
✅ Enriching alerts using external threat intelligence (VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB).
✅ Creating an incident in TheHive for case management.
✅ Sending notifications to a Discord channel.
✅ (Bonus) Auto-mitigating threats (e.g., blocking malicious IPs).

By implementing this SOAR workflow, you can automate security operations, reduce response time, and improve efficiency in a SOC environment.

🔄 Workflow - Automating Incident Response
📌 Workflow Overview
This workflow automates incident response using Shuffle:
1️⃣ Receive alerts from Wazuh SIEM when suspicious activity is detected.
2️⃣ Enrich the alert using VirusTotal & AbuseIPDB API.
3️⃣ Create an incident in TheHive for case tracking.
4️⃣ Send a notification to Discord with alert details.
5️⃣ (Optional) Perform auto-mitigation (e.g., blocking malicious IPs).

📌 Shuffle Workflow Steps
🔹 Step 1: Add Wazuh Alert as Trigger

In Shuffle, create a new workflow and add a Webhook trigger.
Configure Wazuh to send alerts via webhooks.
🔹 Step 2: Enrich Data with VirusTotal & AbuseIPDB

Add an HTTP Request node to check IPs/Hashes using VirusTotal API.
Add another HTTP Request to query AbuseIPDB for malicious IPs.
🔹 Step 3: Create an Incident in TheHive

Use TheHive API to create a new case with alert details.
🔹 Step 4: Send Alert to Discord

Use the Discord Webhook to send a formatted message to a SOC channel.
🔹 Step 5: (Optional) Auto-Mitigation

If the IP is high risk, trigger a firewall rule to block the attacker.
🚀 Running the Workflow
Step 1: Configure Wazuh to Send Alerts to Shuffle
Edit the Wazuh ossec.conf file to send webhook alerts:

<integration>
  <name>custom-webhook</name>
  <hook_url>http://<shuffle-ip>:5001/webhook</hook_url>
  <event_format>json</event_format>
</integration>
Restart Wazuh to apply changes:

sudo systemctl restart wazuh-manager
Step 2: Configure TheHive API Key
Generate an API key in TheHive and add it to Shuffle’s HTTP Request node.

Step 3: Configure Discord Webhook in Shuffle
Use the Discord Webhook URL in the Shuffle HTTP Request node.
Example payload:

{
  "content": "**🚨 New Security Alert 🚨**\n\nIP: 192.168.1.100\nSeverity: High\nSource: Wazuh SIEM"
}
Step 4: Test the Workflow
Trigger an alert in Wazuh (e.g., failed SSH logins).
Verify the incident is created in TheHive.
Check if the alert is sent to Discord.
📌 Example Output
✅ TheHive Incident Created:

[INFO] New Incident Created in TheHive:
- Title: Suspicious SSH Login Attempts
- Severity: High
- Source: Wazuh SIEM
✅ Discord Alert:

Discord Alert Example

🎯 Future Enhancements
🔹 Add auto-mitigation (e.g., blocking attacker IPs via firewall rules).
🔹 Integrate more threat intelligence feeds (e.g., MISP, Shodan API).
🔹 Expand automation to handle different types of incidents.
